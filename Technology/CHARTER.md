# RISC-V Working Groups: Technology Charter

The Technology HC is an umbrella HC that will provide strategy and oversight for
technology sectors encompassing multiple industries and extensions in RISC-V ISA and
ISA ecosystem (e.g. Embedded SIG under the HC will cover topics across industries like
Automotive, Controllers, Wearables, etc. and groups like Code Size Reduction, EABI, etc.).
This HC will identify gaps across industries and RISC-V groups and create
SIGs/TGs/HCs that will address these gaps. It will be a home for any SIGs/TGs/HCs
that are created and represent them to the greater RVI community. Sign off for other
TG/HC work will flow through the Technology HC to the corresponding SIGs under it.
The HC will also help the groups under its umbrella successfully interoperate and
influence other groups regarding their topic areas. Finally, the HC will help its
constituent groups evolve to become a HC or TG as appropriate.
