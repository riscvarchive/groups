# RISC-V Working Groups: ISA-Infrastructure Charter

The ISA Infrastructure HC is an umbrella HC that will provide strategy and oversight for topics and technology artifacts required to support the RISC-V ISA and ISA ecosystem and Definition of Done policy. The committee will identify gaps in the infrastructure and initiate efforts to fill those. The committee group will not be responsible for doing the actual work. Instead, it will define strategies and requirements, and ensure the infrastructure is in place for Task Groups to develop and release infrastructure components necessary for them to reach ratification and successful adoption of an extension. This HC will be involved with Task Groups and SIGs to help them correctly fulfill the Definition of Done Tasks and broader ecosystem components (like CI performance testing) by educating about, reviewing, and signing off on those efforts. Examples here might include Documentation format and style or Architecture tests.
